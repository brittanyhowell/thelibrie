As we all know sprinkles are the best possible food source and if we could subsist on a diet of sprinkles alone that would be ideal.
One day we will make this a biological possibility, and until then we will continue consuming them at a reasonable level.

May I present: Sprinkle cookies.
They are a shortbread cookie, but a bit softer, with a number of colours somewhere in the range of 100s to 1000s.
