Everyone has those habits that don't really, help you.
They're easy, they're fun, but in the end they leave you feeling worse.
This song takes those vices and projects them onto a physical devil.

Oh, devil, I'm glad that you came
Guess I should learn how to live because it won't go away

The pre-chorus has these echo-y vocals that sound like you're being sucked into your hedonistic choices. Exactly where the devil wants you.

"dancing devil" *devil is back again*, "never look back"

Stay here where it's warm!

You snap out of the daydream.You're back here for a while.
"But devil is right there on the contacts"

When you sink into the devil's choices, you don't need to visit hell, you've made it yourself.

The chorus, groovin' devil.

Bridge: Same old thing, same old show, SHOW CONTROL.
It's the only way.

The end is a little perplexing.
"lucifer, I need your help"
