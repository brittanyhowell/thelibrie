Cane Shuga / How to be a Human Being / Glass Animals

How to be a Human Being is a book about people, the people on the cover.
Listening to the full album is like walking through a neighbourhood full of weird intermingled relationships.

I love them all. So I'll start with Cane Shuga.

Cane shuga opens with this clean melody bouncing purposefully up and down the scale.You get fully acquainted with the whole motif, then the beat comes to hang.

Now the intro isn't fast, the beat doesn't make your heart race, but the slow, mesmerising lyrics are still a shift down.
Then it switches up into drug influenced gibberish:
'steam rolled hair look into the glare and pop it brother slick like 007 man you fly Kim jung rockets with ya'

It's almost as if the beat and that original melody are normal time and this guy has two modes: chill comatose emotional softie, promising to clean himself up, and _Slick Bro Ready To Go_.

This is what I love about Glass Animals.
They could have written lyrics with explicit reference to coking yourself into oblivion, and lamenting the loss of everyone who once respected you. Instead they painted a picture of the product - this man in his speedos.
They don't thrash that he's regretful, or sad, or wants to be clean.
They just tell his story.
