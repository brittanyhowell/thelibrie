## Ingredients

- 175 g Icing sugar
- 40g cornflour
- 0.25 t Salt
- 3 T Water
- 1 t Vanilla Extract
- Food Colouring

## Instructions

1. Kit prep: fit a small piping tip in a piping bag, have more bags ready to go
2. Combine the sugar, cornflour, salt, water & vanilla
3. Separate into bowls, and add colours
4. Add first colour to the piping bag - make lines for sprinkles, dots are also an option
5. Once the colour is complete, remove the piping tip and start with the second, repeat until rainbow is complete.

### Notes

You don't really have to use a piping tip, cutting a hole in the end of the bag will suffice.
The mixture is thic though so be warned you might blow through the bag if you aren't careful.
